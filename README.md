Question: What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day? Predicting the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours


Solution: In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables Scores and Hours spent. Also by looking at the plot we can say as no of study hrs increases that score/ percentage of student also increases.
